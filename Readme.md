# Diffrhythm


## Train

## Inference

You can use inference script:
```bash
bash script/infer.sh 
```
Example files of lrc and reference audio can be found in `infer/example`.

BTW, our model currently supports the generation of only 95 seconds of music. We will later release the model to generate 285 seconds.
